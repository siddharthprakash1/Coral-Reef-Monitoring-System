<h1>Coral Reef Monitoring System</h1>

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project on monitoring and protecting coral reefs through temperature measurement using IoT technology. The project aims to develop a smart monitoring system that collects and analyzes temperature data to safeguard coral reef ecosystems.

<h1>Overview</h1>
The Coral Reef Monitoring System is built using Contiki OS and the Cooja simulator. It utilizes Sky-Websense motes as temperature sensors and a border router as the server to receive and analyze the temperature data. The system simulates the measurement of ocean temperatures to understand the health of coral reefs.

<h1>Features</h1>
Simulated temperature measurement using Sky-Websense motes
Wireless communication between the sensor nodes and the server
ICMPv6 protocol for network formation and routing
HTTP protocol for data exchange and external system integration
Wireshark analysis for temperature data and network traffic
Installation and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

<h1>bash</h1>
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coral-reef-monitoring.git
Set up the simulation environment with Contiki OS and Cooja simulator.

Configure the network architecture and node parameters in the Contiki OS code.

Build and run the simulation using the Cooja simulator.

Use Wireshark to analyze the captured network traffic and temperature data.
